Methods of Option and Result. .unwrap() panics with a generic message on failure, .expect("x") panics with the message "x" on failure

Panic on 'None' or 'Err', otherwise return the contents of 'Some' or 'Ok'

  let n = Some(7).unwrap(); // n is now 7
  let n = None.unwrap(); // program panics
Note .unwrap_or() and unwrap_or_else(). Useful for supplying a default value in a few situations

Could return an 'Option' â€” what 'Vec' does. This indicates that popping an empty stack is not to be regarded as an error, but you should handle it.
