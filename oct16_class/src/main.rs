Note .unwrap_or() and unwrap_or_else(). Useful for supplying a default value in a few situations

/*Versioning and Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
Crates typically follow the principles of Semantic Versioning (SemVer),
 which includes version numbers like 1.2.3, 
 where the major version may change for breaking changes, 
 minor versions for backwards-compatible additions, 
 and patch versions for backwards-compatible bug fixes. 

 for Rust: 
 Three-part version numbers: breaking.major.minor
Rust convention also says 0.breaking.minor

 Cargo.toml has version matching rules: usually want just the breaking part
Cargo.lock preserves Cargo's versioning choices

/*'pub'
By default, nothing in a module is visible outside the module/crate in which it is declared

You can put pub in front of an item to make it externally visible

For things like structs and enums, the visibility of the thing and its fields is controlled separately
pub struct foo{f1:int } is different pub struct foo{ pub f1:int } 

The compiler will whine at you about an unused thing unless it is pub, in which case it assumes you just know it will be used somewhere

*/Tests
Marking a function with #[test] makes it a test
Tests fail by panicking (#[should_panic] tests fail by not panicking)
Test panics usually from asserts: assert!(), assert_eq!()
Marking an item #[cfg(test)] makes it included only when compiling for testing
Examples in doc comments are treated as "doc tests" by default: must compile and not panic ---- !
